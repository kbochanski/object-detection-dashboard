# Streamlit Object Detection

Example object detection application using [Streamlit](https://docs.streamlit.io/) for UI. You can download model weights [here](https://github.com/patrick013/Object-Detection---Yolov3). Application pages use python subpackages eg. `image_detection/` to decouple user interface from computer vision model logic.
